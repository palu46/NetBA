This project focuses on player tracking and visual analysis in NBA basketball games using computer vision techniques. 

The main objectives are:

- **Player Detection & Tracking**: Identify and follow the players on the court throughout the game footage, even when the camera angle changes.
- **Homographic Court Transformation**: Generate a bird's eye view of the court (top-down perspective) in real-time to visualize player positioning more intuitively.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analyze gameplay dynamics and extract meaningful statistics such as player movement patterns, heatmaps, and positioning metrics.

The project leverages image rectification, homography estimation, and tracking algorithms to achieve these goals.
